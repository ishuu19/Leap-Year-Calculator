# Leap Year Calculator
<br>
This is a simple program that will tell you if the year entered by the user is leap or not. It uses an algorithm to determine whether the year number must be divisible by four â€“ except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400 or not. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.
